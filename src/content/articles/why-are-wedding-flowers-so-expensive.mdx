  - question: "Why do wedding flowers cost so much?"
    answer: "Wedding flower pricing reflects skilled design labor (often 40+ hours per wedding), the perishable nature of flowers requiring precise timing, seasonal availability affecting sourcing costs, and the logistics of delivery and on-site installation."
  - question: "What percentage of a wedding budget should go to flowers?"
    answer: "Florals typically represent 8-15% of a total wedding budget. For a $50,000 wedding, that's $4,000-$7,500."
  - question: "Are wedding flowers marked up?"
    answer: "Professional florists typically apply a 2.5-3.5x markup on wholesale flower costs, which covers design time, processing, storage, transportation, setup, and breakdown — not just the flowers themselves."

## The Real Story Behind Wedding Flower Pricing

When you see your floral proposal, you might wonder: *why does a centerpiece cost $150 when I can buy flowers at the grocery store for $15?* It's a fair question with a nuanced answer.

### 1. Skilled Labor Is the Biggest Cost

A single wedding typically requires **40-60 hours of labor** across the team:

- **Consultation & design** (3-5 hours) — Understanding your vision, creating mood boards, sourcing specific varieties
- **Flower processing** (6-10 hours) — Receiving shipments, hydrating, removing thorns and foliage, conditioning
- **Arrangement creation** (15-25 hours) — Hand-building every bouquet, centerpiece, and installation
- **Delivery & setup** (4-8 hours) — Carefully transporting arrangements, installing on-site, making final adjustments
- **Breakdown** (2-4 hours) — Returning after your event to remove all floral elements

Your florist isn't just arranging flowers — they're project-managing a perishable art installation.

### 2. Flowers Are Perishable

Unlike most wedding vendors (photographers deliver files, DJs bring equipment they reuse), **florists work with a product that's actively dying**. This means:

- Flowers must be ordered with precise timing
- Cold storage facilities are required
- Waste is inevitable — some percentage of stems won't meet quality standards
- There's no "redo" — if something goes wrong, you can't just reprint it

### 3. Seasonal Availability & Sourcing

Not every flower is available year-round. When you request specific varieties:

- **In-season, domestic** = most affordable
- **In-season, imported** = moderate cost increase
- **Out-of-season** = significant premium if available at all
- **Rare or specialty** = highest tier, sometimes requiring months-advance ordering

### 4. The Supply Chain

Your flowers travel a remarkable journey:

Grower → Auction/Wholesaler → Regional distributor → Your florist → Your venue

Each step adds handling, cold-chain logistics, and cost. Many premium stems originate in Ecuador, Colombia, Holland, or California before reaching your local florist.

### 5. What You're Really Paying For

When you hire a professional wedding florist, the flowers themselves represent roughly **25-35% of the total cost**. The rest covers:

- Design expertise and creative direction
- Labor and skilled artistry
- Business overhead (studio, vehicles, insurance)
- Equipment and supplies (vases, foam, wire, ribbon)
- Logistics and coordination
- The guarantee that it all comes together perfectly on your day
