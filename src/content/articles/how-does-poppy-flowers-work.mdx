## Your Journey with Poppy

We've designed our process to be transparent, collaborative, and stress-free. Here's exactly what to expect.

### Step 1: Discovery Consultation

Everything starts with a conversation. We want to understand:

- Your **wedding vision** — colors, style, mood
- Your **venue** — space, lighting, existing decor
- Your **must-haves** — dream flowers, specific arrangements
- Your **budget** — so we can maximize every dollar

This consultation is complimentary and takes about 30 minutes. You can share Pinterest boards, fabric swatches, or just describe a feeling — we'll translate it into florals.

### Step 2: Custom Proposal

Within a week of your consultation, you'll receive a **detailed proposal** that includes:

- Itemized list of every arrangement
- Suggested flower varieties with photos
- Color palette visualization
- Transparent pricing with no hidden fees
- Timeline for your wedding day

This isn't a generic template — it's designed specifically for your wedding, your venue, and your vision.

### Step 3: Design Refinement

Your proposal is a starting point, not a final answer. During this phase:

- **Swap flowers** — Want garden roses instead of ranunculus? Done.
- **Adjust scale** — Need to trim the budget or go bigger? We'll restructure.
- **Add elements** — Realized you want an arch? We'll design one.
- **Finalize details** — Lock in colors, textures, and finishing touches.

We typically go through 2-3 rounds of refinement. There's no rush and no pressure.

### Step 4: Wedding-Day Delivery

In the weeks before your wedding:

- We confirm all flower orders with our suppliers
- Process and condition every stem in our studio
- Build your arrangements with meticulous care
- Deliver and install everything according to your timeline
- Handle breakdown after the celebration

**On your wedding day, you don't think about flowers once** — that's our goal. They're simply there, beautiful and exactly right.
