## What Should You Budget for Wedding Flowers?

Wedding flowers are one of the most visible elements of your celebration, and understanding the investment helps you plan with confidence. Here's what real couples spend:

### Budget Ranges

| Tier | Investment | What You Get |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Essential** | $2,000–$4,000 | Bridal bouquet, 2-3 attendant bouquets, boutonnieres, 6-8 centerpieces |
| **Classic** | $4,000–$8,000 | All essentials plus ceremony arch/arrangements, upgraded centerpieces, accent pieces |
| **Elevated** | $8,000–$15,000 | Full ceremony design, lush centerpieces, cocktail hour flowers, personal flowers for full party |
| **Luxury** | $15,000–$25,000+ | Complete venue transformation, hanging installations, aisle treatments, lounge flowers |

### Factors That Affect Your Price

**Flower Selection** — A bouquet of garden roses costs differently than one with peonies flown from Holland. Seasonal, locally-available flowers offer the best value.

**Design Complexity** — A simple gathering of blooms in a vase differs from a structured, architectural arrangement. More complex designs require more labor and expertise.

**Venue Requirements** — Large spaces need larger (or more) arrangements to make an impact. Outdoor venues may need sturdier mechanics to handle wind.

**Guest Count** — More tables means more centerpieces. A 200-person wedding naturally requires more floral investment than a 50-person celebration.

**Season & Availability** — Peonies in January or dahlias in March require special sourcing that increases cost. Working with what's naturally in season saves significantly.
