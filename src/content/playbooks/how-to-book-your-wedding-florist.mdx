## Your Complete Guide to Booking a Wedding Florist

Finding the right florist is one of the most important vendor decisions you'll make. Flowers set the visual tone for your entire celebration. This guide walks you through the process step by step.

### Step 1: Start Your Research (10-12 Months Out)

**Where to look:**
- Instagram — Search hashtags like #[yourcity]weddingflorist
- Wedding publications — Featured weddings showcase florist work
- Venue recommendations — Your venue coordinator knows who does great work in their space
- Planner referrals — Wedding planners have vetted vendor lists

**What to evaluate:**
- Does their portfolio style match your vision?
- Do they work at your venue or similar spaces?
- What's their price range? (Many share starting prices on their website)
- Are they available on your date?

### Step 2: Schedule Consultations (9-11 Months Out)

Narrow your list to 3-5 florists and schedule meetings. Come prepared with:

- **Inspiration images** — 10-15 photos that capture your desired style
- **Wedding details** — Date, venue, estimated guest count, wedding party size
- **Budget range** — Even a rough range helps your florist tailor suggestions
- **Must-haves** — Specific flowers, arrangements, or design elements you're set on

**Questions to ask:**
- How many weddings do you do per weekend?
- Will you personally design and oversee our wedding?
- How do you handle substitutions if a flower isn't available?
- What's included in setup and breakdown?

### Step 3: Review Proposals (8-10 Months Out)

A good proposal should include:
- Itemized list of every arrangement
- Suggested flower varieties and color palette
- Clear pricing with no hidden fees
- Terms for changes and additions
- Cancellation and refund policy

**Comparing proposals:** Don't just compare bottom-line numbers. Compare what's included. A $5,000 proposal with delivery, setup, and rentals might be a better value than a $4,000 proposal that charges those separately.

### Step 4: Book Your Florist (7-9 Months Out)

Once you've chosen your florist:

- Review the contract thoroughly
- Understand the retainer and payment schedule
- Note the timeline for final changes
- Save your florist's preferred communication method

**Pro tip:** Peak season (May-October) dates book fastest. If you're planning a Saturday wedding in June, booking 12+ months out is wise.

### Step 5: Design Refinement (4-6 Months Out)

As your wedding plans evolve, so can your florals:

- Bridesmaid dress colors finalized? Adjust the palette.
- Changed your ceremony layout? Modify the arch design.
- Added a cocktail hour space? Include accent arrangements.

This is the collaborative part — your florist should be responsive and flexible.

### Step 6: Final Details (4-6 Weeks Out)

The home stretch:

- **Final walkthrough** with your florist (in person or video)
- Confirm delivery times and venue access
- Provide final table counts and layout
- Settle remaining balance
- Designate a day-of contact for the florist

After this, your only job is to show up and enjoy the flowers.
