## About The Barn at Edgewood

The Barn at Edgewood is one of the most sought-after rustic-elegant wedding venues in western Pennsylvania. The restored timber-frame barn features soaring 30-foot ceilings, original stone walls, and massive windows that flood the space with natural light.

### Floral Design Considerations

**The Ceremony Space:**
The barn's main hall serves as the ceremony space with a stunning backdrop of aged wood and iron chandeliers. Key floral opportunities:

- **Entrance arrangements** — Frame the barn doors (12 feet tall) with seasonal greenery or climbing floral installations
- **Aisle markers** — Pew-end clusters or shepherd's hooks along the 60-foot center aisle
- **Altar area** — The existing iron chandelier serves as a natural focal point; floral additions should complement rather than compete

**The Reception Space:**
The loft level and covered patio host the reception. Consider:

- **Long farm tables** (seats 8-10) — Garland runners with intermittent bud vases work beautifully with the rustic aesthetic
- **Round tables** (seats 8) — Medium centerpieces in wooden or copper vessels suit the space
- **The bar area** — A statement arrangement on the reclaimed-wood bar creates a focal moment

### What Works Best Here

The Barn at Edgewood has a strong aesthetic identity — warm wood, iron, and stone. Flowers that complement this character include:

- **Organic, garden-gathered styles** over structured, formal designs
- **Warm palettes** — Peach, terracotta, sage, cream, and burgundy
- **Textural variety** — Mix soft blooms with grasses, seed pods, and trailing greenery
- **Seasonal authenticity** — The venue's countryside setting rewards designs that feel connected to the landscape

### Logistics Tips from Our Team

After dozens of weddings at this venue, here's what we've learned:

1. **Arrive early** — The service entrance can get congested with multiple vendors. We recommend arriving at the start of the setup window.
2. **Temperature matters** — In summer, store delicate flowers in your refrigerated vehicle as long as possible. The barn's interior can reach 80°F+ before the AC kicks in.
3. **Use the rigging points** — The barn has pre-approved attachment points for hanging installations. The venue coordinator can share the rigging map.
4. **Bring your own vessels** — The venue's included decor is minimal. Plan on providing all vases, containers, and mechanics.
5. **Breakdown crew** — Schedule a 2-person crew for post-event floral removal within the 2-hour window.
