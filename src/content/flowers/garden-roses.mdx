## Why Garden Roses Are a Wedding Favorite

Garden roses sit at the intersection of classic elegance and romantic abundance. Unlike standard long-stem roses (the kind you'd get at a flower shop), garden roses feature:

- **Full, multi-petaled blooms** — 60-100+ petals per flower
- **Intoxicating fragrance** — One of the most beautifully scented cut flowers
- **Soft, romantic form** — Cupped, rosette, or ruffled shapes that photograph beautifully
- **Premium variety** — David Austin roses, the most popular garden rose breeder, has spent decades developing varieties specifically for cutting

### Seasonal Availability

Garden roses are at their peak from **late spring through early fall** (May–October). During winter months, availability is more limited and pricing increases. However, some varieties are grown year-round in controlled greenhouse environments in Ecuador and Colombia.

**Peak season** — June through September offers the widest variety selection and best pricing.

**Off-season tip** — If you're set on garden roses for a winter wedding, book early so your florist can secure allocations from specialty growers.

### Design Versatility

What makes garden roses extraordinary for weddings is their versatility:

- A **bridal bouquet** of 12-15 Juliet garden roses is breathtakingly simple
- Mixed with **ranunculus and peonies**, they create lush, romantic arrangements
- Paired with **greenery and herbs** (eucalyptus, rosemary), they feel organic and fresh
- In a **moody palette** with Tess and burgundy dahlias, they're dramatic and modern

### Investment Guide

At **$6-14 per stem** (wholesale), garden roses are a premium flower — but each bloom has the visual impact of 3-4 standard roses. A single garden rose can be a boutonniere; five can anchor a centerpiece.

**Budget tip:** Use garden roses as focal flowers and surround them with more affordable supporting blooms like spray roses, lisianthus, or stock.
